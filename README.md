# -DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-5-STAGE-PIPELINE-OF-RISC-V-PROCESSOR-OUT-OF-ORDER
🔹 Slightly Detailed (great for CDAC / VLSI profiles)  This project implements a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor with out-of-order execution using RTL design. Key features include instruction buffering, register renaming, dynamic issue, hazard handling, and reorder buffer–based commit for precise exceptions.
